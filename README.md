## Useful Pages for external services to link to

| PATH  | Page Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| ```/mandate/agent/service ``` | Shows a list of services that the agent can create mandates for |
| ```/mandate/agent/summary/:service``` | Shows any pending or current clients for a given service. Also has a link to create a mandate for a new client |
| ```/mandate/email/:service``` | Starts the process of creating a mandate for a new client |
| ```/mandate/client/email``` | Starts the process for the client to accept a mandate |


# Adding a new service

## First service to be added after ATED
Note: If this is the first service to be added after ATED then the feature switch at MandateFeatureSwitches.singleService will have to be removed.
This feature switch causes the ```/mandate/agent/service ``` to be skipped and go straight to the ATED summary page.

## Adding a new service to the view
Update the page selectService.scala.html to add any new services that the agent can choose from.

## Update the application.conf to add links back to the new service
Ensure that you update application.conf with the links back to the dev version of your service.
i.e.

```
  delegated-service-redirect-url {
    ated = "http://localhost:9916/ated/account-summary"
  }

  delegated-service-home-url {
    ated = "http://localhost:9916/ated/welcome"
  }
```

| Property | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| delegated-service-redirect-url | The page that the agent will return to when they click on a client after it's accepted the mandate |
| delegated-service-home-url | After the agent has created a mandated they're told to get the client to visit this page to log in and accept it |
